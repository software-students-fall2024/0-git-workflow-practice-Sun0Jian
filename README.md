##why is this interesting: 

This article mentioned many aspects of software development. It touches on how software development is pervasive in various industries and is crucial for product differentiation, citing examples like AI customer service advisors and cloud-based ride-sharing services. As an AI prodcut customer I have tried many different generative AI, and I believe most of the users do not really care, or even know which model is better. The important thing is how the program interact with people, and how each part of the program collaborate, show the results to the customers. This might be an importance of software development.
